# A Tracking Two-Way Communication Dog Harness that uses LoRa

## Description
This group project was developed for ECE 342 - Junior Design, a class at Oregon State University.

The harness can be used to reliably track your dog up to 0.7 miles (as of this version). It also provides temperature and battery voltage readings. Two other analog sensors can be incorporated into the harness. The battery life has been tested to be more than 12 hours and can probably last more than 48 hours on a single charge.

## Unique Feature:-
You can use the switch on the Alpha Transceiver to trigger a buzzer on the Beta Transceiver. Hence, your dog will be able to hear the buzzer. You can train your dog to "return" when it hears the buzzer. The buzzer can also be modified to ring at a frequency that only dogs and not humans can hear.
